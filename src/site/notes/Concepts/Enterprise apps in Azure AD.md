# about

Enterprise apps in Azure AD refer to the cloud-based applications that are designed to meet the needs of large organizations. These apps are designed to streamline business processes, enhance productivity, and improve collaboration across teams. They are available in the Azure AD app gallery and can be integrated with other Microsoft services, such as Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform.

Enterprise apps in Azure AD support single sign-on (SSO), which enables users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. This helps organizations to improve security by enforcing strong authentication policies and reducing the risk of password-related security breaches.

Azure AD also provides app management capabilities for enterprise apps, including user provisioning, group management, and access control. Administrators can use these features to manage user access to specific applications based on their roles and responsibilities within the organization.

Overall, enterprise apps in Azure AD provide a secure and efficient way for organizations to manage their cloud-based applications and improve their business processes.
