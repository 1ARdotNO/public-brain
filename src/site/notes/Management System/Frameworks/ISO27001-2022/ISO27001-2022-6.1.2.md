# Description

The organization shall define and apply an information security risk assessment process that: 
a) establishes and maintains information security risk criteria that include: 
- 1) the risk acceptance criteria; and 
- 2) criteria for performing information security risk assessments; 
b) ensures that repeated information security risk assessments produce consistent, valid and comparable results; 
c) identifies the information security risks: 
- 1) apply the information security risk assessment process to identify risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability for information within the scope of the information security management system; and 
- 2) identify the risk owners; 
d) analyses the information security risks: 
- 1) assess the potential consequences that would result if the risks identified in 6.1.2 c) 1) were to materialize; 
- 2) assess the realistic likelihood of the occurrence of the risks identified in 6.1.2 c) 1); and 
- 3) determine the levels of risk; 
e) evaluates the information security risks: 
- 1) compare the results of risk analysis with the risk criteria established in 6.1.2 a); and 
- 2) prioritize the analysed risks for risk treatment. 

The organization shall retain documented information about the information security risk assessment process.
