Business Impact Analysis Template

Introduction:

The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a process that evaluates the potential effects of an interruption of business operations. The purpose of this analysis is to establish priorities for recovery and ensure minimal disruption to the organization's operations.

Business Function:

Identify and describe the critical business functions that need to be evaluated during the BIA process.

Impact Assessment:

This section should include a detailed assessment of the potential impact on each critical business function in case of an interruption. The assessment should cover the following aspects:

1. Financial Impact: What will be the financial impact on the organization if a critical business function is interrupted?

2. Operational Impact: How will an interruption affect day-to-day operations?

3. Reputational Impact: Will an interruption have any negative impact on the organization's reputation?

4. Legal and Regulatory Impact: Will there be any legal or regulatory implications as a result of an interruption?

5. Supply Chain Impact: How will suppliers, distributors, and other partners be affected by an interruption?

Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs):

Establish recovery time objectives for each critical business function. RTOs should define how quickly each function needs to be restored after an interruption.

Critical Dependencies:

Identify all dependencies for each critical business function, including technology systems, facilities, personnel, and suppliers.

Risk Assessment:

Evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of risks that could lead to an interruption.

Mitigation Strategies:

Develop mitigation strategies for each identified risk, including prevention, response, and recovery measures.

Conclusion:

Summarize key findings from the BIA process and recommend actions to minimize disruption to critical business functions in case of an interruption.
