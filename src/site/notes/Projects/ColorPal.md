### about
ColorPal is a friendly companion to generate a set of colors for design/websitelayout/etc. It tries its best to generate colors that match, but will not always succeed.

It is a small project I created for learning some [[JS\|JS]] Basics 
It is hosted on github pages and the code is available for review there for anyone interested.
