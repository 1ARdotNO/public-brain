# Description

When a Nonconformity occurs, the organization shall:
1. React to the nonconformity, and as applicable:
    1. take action to control and correct it;
    2. deal with the consequences
2. evaluate the need for action to eliminate the causes of nonconformity, in order that it does not recur or occur elsewhere, by;
    1. reviewing the nonconformity;
    2. determining the causes of the nonconformity; and
    3. determining if similar nonconformities exist, or could potentially occur
3. implement any action needed;
4. review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken; and
5. make changes to the information security management system, if necessary. 

Corrective actions shall be appropriate to the effects of the nonconformities encountered.
Documented information shall be available as evidence of:
1. The nature of the nonconformities and any subsequent actions taken,
2. the results of any corrective action.
