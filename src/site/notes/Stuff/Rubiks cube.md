### STEP 1 Solve the Upper Cross


### STEP 2 Solve the Green Corner
Algorithm used for this step ( Ri Di R D ) x1,3 or 5.


### Step 3 Middle Layer Edges
Algorithms used it this step.
Right Move (U R Ui Ri Ui Fi U F)
Left Move (Ui Li U L U F Ui Fi) 


### Step 4 Upper Blue Cross
Algarithm used in this Step (F R U Ri Ui Fi)


### Step 5 Top Edges
Algorithm used in this step (R U Ri U R U U Ri)


### Step 6 Top Corners
Algorithm Used for this step (U R Ui Li U Ri Ui L) The way I reamembered this step.(Earl, Earl) Spelled Urul Urul Just remember that the first Earl's last two steps are inverted and then with the secound earl either remember the middle two are inverted, or if you're realy good at lodgic you can remember that the first Earl messes it up and then the secound Earl fixes what you messed up.


### Step 7 Solving the Cube
Algarithm used in this step (Ri Di R D)x2 or 4.
