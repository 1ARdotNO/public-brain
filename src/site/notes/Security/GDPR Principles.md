Managing and storing personal data in compliance with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) requires careful consideration. Here are key steps and best practices to follow:

**1. Data Minimization**

- Only collect personal data that is necessary for your research. In your case, names and contact information are essential for scheduling interviews.

**2. Consent**

- Obtain explicit, informed consent from each participant. This means explaining:

- Why you are collecting their data.
- How it will be used.
- How long it will be stored.
- That they can withdraw their consent at any time.

- The consent form should be clear and separate from other terms and conditions.

**3. Data Protection and Privacy**

- Ensure that the data is stored securely.
- Limit access to the data to only those who need it for the research.

**4. Data Retention Policy**

- Specify how long you will keep the data. It should only be held for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose of the research.
- After this period, ensure that the data is securely deleted.

**5. Rights of the Data Subjects**

- Inform participants of their rights under GDPR, including:

- The right to access their personal data.
- The right to correct inaccurate data.
- The right to delete their data.
- The right to restrict processing.
- The right to data portability.

**6. Data Processing Agreement**

- If you are using third parties to process personal data (e.g., cloud storage, transcription services), you need a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) to ensure they also comply with GDPR.

**7. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**

- If the research involves sensitive data or could significantly impact individuals, conducting a DPIA might be necessary. This helps identify and mitigate risks related to data processing.

**8. Documentation**

- Keep detailed records of all the data processing activities, including consent forms, information about data collection, processing, and retention.

**9. Notify the Data Protection Officer (DPO)**

- If your organization has a DPO, keep them informed about the project and ensure compliance with internal and GDPR guidelines.
