ZeroTier is a virtual private network (VPN) service that allows users to securely connect devices and create their own private networks over the internet. Unlike traditional VPNs, ZeroTier uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture that enables direct communication between devices without the need for a centralized server.

ZeroTier was founded in 2014 by Adam Ierymenko, who previously worked on networking technologies for the US Department of Defense. The service has gained popularity among remote workers, gamers, and developers who need secure and reliable connectivity across different devices and locations.

One of the main benefits of ZeroTier is its ease of use. Users can download the client software for free from the official website or app store and easily set up their network by creating an account and inviting other users to join. The service works on various platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, as well as routers and IoT devices.

Another advantage of ZeroTier is its security features. The service uses end-to-end encryption to protect all data transmitted between devices. It also supports two-factor authentication and allows users to set up access controls based on IP addresses or specific users.

ZeroTier offers both free and paid plans with different features and limitations. The free plan allows users to create up to 100 networks with unlimited members but limits data transfer to 100 MB per month per device. The paid plans start at $5 per month per network and offer higher data transfer limits, priority support, custom branding options, and other advanced features.

Overall, ZeroTier is a reliable and user-friendly VPN service that offers secure connectivity across devices and locations without the need for complex configurations or expensive hardware. Its P2P architecture also makes it more resilient to network failures or attacks compared to centralized VPNs.
