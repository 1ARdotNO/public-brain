- 2) identify the risk owners; 
d) analyses the information security risks: 
- 1) assess the potential consequences that would result if the risks identified in 6.1.2 c) 1) were to materialize; 
- 2) assess the realistic likelihood of the occurrence of the risks identified in 6.1.2 c) 1); and 
- 3) determine the levels of risk; 
e) evaluates the information security risks:
