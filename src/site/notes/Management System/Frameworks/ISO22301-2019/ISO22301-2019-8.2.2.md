# Description

The organization shall use the process for analysing business impacts to determine business continuity priorities and requirements. The process shall: a) define the impact types and criteria relevant to the organizationï¿½s context; b) identify the activities that support the provision of products and services; c) use the impact types and criteria for assessing the impacts over time resulting from the disruption of these activities; d) identify the time frame within which the impacts of not resuming activities would become unacceptable to the organization; e) set prioritized time frames within the time identified in d) for resuming disrupted activities at a specified minimum acceptable capacity; f) use this analysis to identify prioritized activities; g) determine which resources are needed to support prioritized activities; h) determine the dependencies, including partners and suppliers, and interdependencies of prioritized activities. NOTE 1 This time frame can be referred to as the "maximum tolerable period of disruption (MTPD)". NOTE 2 This time frame can be referred to as the "recovery time objective (RTO)".
